story utorial

the intern

 the intern is a tutorial click game inside this app

  it just points out the features but u need to click hi a few times before he realizes hes guiding u

   the pun is that hes high af
so every like 4 times you click, he gudies u, the 3 prior cilcks are him staring at his hands
or not realizing hes a guide bc hes distracted

it has real life correlation to tour huides imo, i hope th pun works

and its a mode which can be unlocked

theres also a normal tut which is readliy accesible. this onse is a easter egg
